### Important
This repository is based on the github repository "deep-iforest" by "xuhongzuo". This repo provides an online algorithm to the original
Deep Isolation Forest algorithm. This repo is a suppliment to the paper Onine Deep Isolation Forest which is based on the paper Deep Isolation 
Forest. 

### Important Files
As this repo is experimental, most of the files came with the orginal deep-iforest. We have created many files experimentally some of
which are not required or will not be used. Please ignore the naming of some of the important files as some of them still contain the 
word "test" or even "copy". We will fix the names as soon as we can. The important/significant files are:
1. algorithms/dif.py - comes with the deep-iforest repo but we modified it 
2. main6.py - we run the experiments from there; this is a modified version of the main.py came with deep-iforest; 
3. dif_test_dataset_2_copy.py - contains among others our online algorithm and some custom implementations emulating some necessary scikit learn functions
